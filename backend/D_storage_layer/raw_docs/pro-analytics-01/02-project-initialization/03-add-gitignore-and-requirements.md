# ðŸŸ  03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md

This page provides instructions to add common files to a new project repository. 

- `.gitignore` is used to keep things out of GitHub like .venv and secrets
- `requirements.txt` is a good way to list and install external dependencies

## Before Starting

Open your repository in VS Code. 

## Task 1. Create `.gitignore` 

Create a new file in your root repo folder named exactly: `.gitignore`
IMPORTANT: Spelling, capitalization, and name are critical. 
If the name or location is not exact, it will not work. 

Find the `.gitignore` file in the root of this [pro-analytics-01](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/) repo and paste the entire contents into your `.gitignore` file.
This is a good starting point for many Python projects. 
Actual `.gitignore` contents will vary by project. 


## Task 2. Create `requirements.txt`

Create a new file in your root project folder named exactly: `requirements.txt`.
IMPORTANT: Spelling, capitalization, and name are critical. If the name or location is not exact, the commands we provide will not work. 

Find the `requirements.txt` file in the root of this [pro-analytics-01](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/) repo and paste the entire contents into your `requirements.txt`file.
This is a good starting point for many Python projects. 
Actual `requirements.txt` contents will vary by project. 

## Experience 

**IMPORTANT**: Read through the files - try to understand the purpose of these files. 
Know how and why we vary the contents.
Experience comes from working with these files and understanding how to manage them for a project.
