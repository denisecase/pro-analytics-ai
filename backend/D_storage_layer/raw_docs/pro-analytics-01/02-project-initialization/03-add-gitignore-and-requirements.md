# 03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md

This page provides instructions to add common files to a new project repository. 

- .gitignore is used to keep things out of GitHub like .venv and secrets
- requirements.txt is a good way to list and install external dependencies

## Before Starting

Open your project repository in VS Code. 

## Task 1. Create .gitignore 

Create a new file in your root project folder named exactly: .gitignore
If the name or location is not exact, it will not work. 

Find the .gitignore file in the root of this repo and paste the entire contents into your file.
This is a good starting point for Python projects. 
Actual contents will vary by project. 


## Task 2. Create requirements.txt

Create a new file in your root project folder named exactly: requirements.txt.
If the name or location is not exact, it will not work. 

Find the requirements.txt file in the root of this repo and paste the entire contents into your file.
This is a good starting point for Python projects. 
Actual contents will vary by project. 

## Experience 

Read and understand the purpose of these files. 
Know how and why we vary the contents.
Experience comes from working with these files and understanding how to manage them for a project.
