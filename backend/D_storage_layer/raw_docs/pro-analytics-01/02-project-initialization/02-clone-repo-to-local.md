# 02-clone-repo-to-local.md

This page provides instructions to copy a GitHub repository to a local machine. 

## Before Starting

Open your project repository in VS Code. 

We'll open a new terminal in VS Code and run a single command. 

## Copy the URL to the GitHub Repository

In your browser, view your GitHub repo - you should see your account name and the repo name in the browser address bar. 
For example, this URL looks like <https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01>

Use CTRL a to select all and CTRL c to copy the URL to your clipboard. Mac/Linux CMD a, CMD c.


## Task 1. Clone Repository to Local Machine

Run the following command from the project root directory. 
Type git clone and paste your URL. The following is only an example. 
The command works in PowerShell, bash, zsh, Git Bash, and more. 
 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/youraccount/yourrepo
```
