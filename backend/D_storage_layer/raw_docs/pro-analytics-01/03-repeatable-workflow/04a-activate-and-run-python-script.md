This page explains how to run a Python file (`.py`) in VS Code. 
When we run a Python file directly, we run it as a Python script. Scripts are useful for clear, modular code that we can import into other files and/or schedule to run on a regular basis.

## Important Note

Use this only when your project runs **Python script (`.py`)** files. 
If your project only has Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) files, you will not need this. 

## Before Starting

Open your project repository folder in VS Code. 
Open a terminal. 
We must activate the .venv - if you've already done so, you don't need to rerun that command. 

We must have installed all the external dependencies needed for our project to run into the virtual environment first. 

## Task 1. Select VS Code Interpreter

VS Code needs our populated .venv to interpret our files correctly.

To set the VS Code Interpreter:

1. Open the Command Palette: Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
2. Search for "Python: Select Interpreter":
3. Type Python: Select Interpreter in the Command Palette search bar and select it from the dropdown.
4. Choose an Interpreter - A list of available Python environments will appear. Look for the local .venv option.
5. Once selected, check the Python version displayed 
  in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window in the status bar.


### Making Changes / Saving

Now we can get help from the VS Code editor while working on the Python code files. 

After making changes, run the file to verify following the steps below.
Save your files periodically to avoid losing progress - or make sure the File / Autosave option is on. 


## Windows Task 2: Activate/Execute

1. Ensure .venv is active. If active, you don't need to rerun the activate command.
2. Run the file. 

IMPORTANT: Change the name of the file to your actual file. 
The file must exist in the root project folder for the execute command to work. 

Run the following commands from the project root directory. 
The commands work in PowerShell.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
py myfile.py
```


## Mac/Linux Task 2: Activate/Execute

1. Ensure .venv is active. If active, you don't need to rerun the activate command.
2. Run the file.

IMPORTANT: Change the name of the file to your actual file. 
The file must exist in the root project folder for the execute command to work. 

Run the following commands from the project root directory. 
The commands work in zsh, bash, and more.

```powershell
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 demo-script.py
```


## AS-NEEDED: New External Dependencies

If any new external dependencies have been added to any Python scripts, add the external dependencies to requirements.txt and re-run the install dependencies process first. 

## Experience

- Understand why the virtual environment must be activated first. 
- Understand when adding a new external dependency, we must first add it to requirements.txt and re-run the install command. 
- Record your process and steps in your project README.md as you go.
