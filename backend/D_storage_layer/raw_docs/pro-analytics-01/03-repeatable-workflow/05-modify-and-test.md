When working on a project always open that project repository folder in VS Code. 
Remember that in general, terminal commands are intended to be executed in the root project folder. 

Use the VS Code menu to turn on autosave (File / Autosave) - or remember to save your changes as you work. 

Test your code and ensure it works. 

Use git add-commit-push frequently to commit small sets of well-labeled changes to the repository. A good commit history helps identify where things might have gone wrong (or where they got fixed).

In general, do not git add-commit-push if the code doesn't run. Comment out content as needed to get a version that runs without errors before doing git add-commit-push.
