## Windows Users
For Windows machines with OneDrive enabled, the Documents folder is not ideal for our projects due to OneDrive's automatic syncing. 
It slows things down when working with Python projects. 

Our projects will be large (they use a lot of free code) - and we'll back them up ourselves using GitHub. 

We recommend creating a dedicated folder outside of OneDrive's sync scope, for example, a folder named Projects in the root of your C: drive (i.e. C:\Projects, directions below).

This ensures that Python projects, including potentially large virtual environment directories, are not automatically synced to OneDrive or other cloud storage systems and will not incur slow response times when working. 

### Windows Task 1. Create C:\Projects Directory

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to C:\.
3. Create a new folder named Projects.

Important

- Spelling and capitalization matter a great deal in programming. 
- Be sure to capitalize the "P" in Projects as programming is case-sensitive.
- Verify the new folder is located directly in your C:\ (C:\Projects), not inside another folder like Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure the new directory is not being backed up by OneDrive or other sync services. Check OneDrive settings.

## Mac/Linux Users
We recommend keeping your projects organized and outside any cloud-sync directories like iCloud's Desktop or Documents. 
This ensures smoother performance, especially when working with Python projects, and avoids syncing unnecessary transient files.

### Mac/Linux Task 1. Create ~/Projects Directory

1. Click the Finder icon in your Dock to open a new Finder window.
2. Access Your Home Directory: In the Finder menu bar at the top of your screen, click Go, then select Home. Alternatively, press Command + Shift + H to open your Home folder.
3. Right-click (or Control-click) in the Home folder and select New Folder. Name the folder Projects.

Important

- Spelling and capitalization matter a great deal in programming. 
- Be sure to capitalize the "P" in Projects as programming is case-sensitive.
- Verify the new folder is located directly in your Home folder (~/Projects), not inside another folder like Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure this folder is not being backed up by iCloud if you have iCloud syncing enabled for your Desktop or Documents. To check: Go to System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options and ensure "Desktop & Documents Folders" is unchecked.
